# Project 1 - *FLICKS*

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [x] User can search for a movie.
- [x] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [x] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Check internet connection error
2. Load more page of movie when users scroll down

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The search function took me a lot of time to figure it out because most of
tutorial I found online they only store the data in an array so it is very
easy to loop thru and find search for specific item but for this app I was using
and dictionary instead of array.

In this app, I also used some codes that I found at http://www.brianjcoleman.com/tutorial-check-for-internet-connection-in-swift/ to check for the internet connection.
